<p>This is the first episode in a series of blog posts exploring how
mental representations became a cornerstone of psychology and cognitive
neuroscience, from the early 20th century to the present day. This
episode focuses on the “crisis of confidence” the field faced in the
early 1900s and the novel quantitative paradigm that allowed researchers
to objectively quantify psychological phenomena, perhaps for the first
time.</p>
<h2>The Crisis of Confidence</h2>
<p>In the early 20th century, psychology was facing an identity crisis.
As Joel Michell points out in his 1999 book, Measurement in Psychology
<span class="citation" data-cites="michell1999measurement"><a
href="#ref-michell1999measurement" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>,
the field was under immense pressure to match the quantitative rigor of
physics. At the time, giants like Einstein, Bohr, and Planck were
revolutionizing our understanding of the physical world, not just
through new theories, but through experiments that verified many of
their predictions.</p>
<p>Psychology, by contrast, struggled for respect within the scientific
community. There was a desperate need for a quantitative framework to
earn academic legitimacy. This struggle was underscored in 1940 by the
Ferguson Report <span class="citation"
data-cites="ferguson1940quantitative"><a
href="#ref-ferguson1940quantitative"
role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>, commissioned by the British
Association for the Advancement of Science. The report concluded that
there was no valid way to perform psychological measurement, effectively
eviscerating the very foundation of psychology as a science at least by
the standards of the time.</p>
<h2>Why is similarity needed? And why not absolute values?</h2>
<p>The root of this evisceration was that psychology lacked a
<strong>ground truth</strong>. In physics, we have absolute standards: a
meter is a meter, and a ruler provides a direct scale for length. In
psychology, however, there is no physical ruler to measure the internal
perception of loudness, even if we can measure the loudness in
decibels.</p>
<p>This problem compounds when considering abstract concepts with no
physical correlate, such as the aesthetic appeal of a painting. How do
you measure beauty on an absolute scale? You cannot. At least not in a
way that is objective and universally agreed upon.</p>
<p>In the midst of this crisis, L.L. Thurstone proposed a breakthrough
in his 1927 paper, A Law of Comparative Judgment <span class="citation"
data-cites="thurstone2017law"><a href="#ref-thurstone2017law"
role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>. He argued that while humans lack an
internal absolute scale, we possess a highly sensitive comparison
mechanism. We are poor at stating, “This sound is exactly 80 decibels,”
but we are excellent at stating, “Sound A is louder than Sound B.” This
insight, that relative judgments are far more consistent than absolute
ones, has been validated many times since then <span class="citation"
data-cites="stewart2005absolute"><a href="#ref-stewart2005absolute"
role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>.</p>

<figcaption><p>Absolute vs Relative Scales. Human perception does not
have an absolute scale to measure against like physical concepts like
length or weight. However, humans possess a high sensitive comparison
mechanism to compare any two stimuli via a relative
scale.</p></figcaption>

<p><span id="fig:absolute_vs_relative_scales"></span></p>
<h2>Scales: The 1D Era</h2>
<p>Relative judgments solved the “ruler” problem, but they didn’t
account for human inconsistency. Factors like attention and fatigue mean
that a person might not give the same answer every time.</p>
<p>Thurstone accounted for this internal noise by modeling judgments as
samples from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution. He proposed that every
time we judge a stimulus, we are essentially drawing a value from a
distribution centered on its true perceived value. More formally, if two
sound stimuli <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are presented to an individual where
the perceived loudness is sampled from <span
class="math inline">\(N\left( \mu_{A},\sigma^{2} \right)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(N\left( \mu_{B},\sigma^{2} \right)\)</span>
independently where <span class="math inline">\(x_{A}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_{B}\)</span> are the samples from the respective
distributions. Then the difference between the two samples is given by
<span class="math inline">\(\delta = x_{A} - x_{B}\)</span>. tells us
the perceived relationship between the two stimuli.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span>, the
individual perceives stimulus <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as
louder than stimulus <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\delta &lt; 0\)</span>, the
individual perceives stimulus <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as
louder than stimulus <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider a thought experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Whisper vs. Bomb Blast</strong>: A listener chooses the
bomb blast 100% of the time. A bomb is significantly louder than a
whisper so there is no confusion</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gunshot vs. Bomb Blast</strong>: A listener chooses the
bomb blast only 80% of the time. A bomb is louder than a gunshot but
sometimes the listener may perceive the gunshot being louder.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The higher “confusion” in the second pair tells us that the gunshot
and bomb blast are much closer together on the internal psychological
scale than the whisper and the blast. A visualization can be seen in the
figure below.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="figures/sound_perception.svg" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<figcaption><p>A whisper and a bomb blast are perceived as very
different in loudness, while a bomb blast and a gun firing are perceived
as less different in loudness due to increase in confusion between the
stimuli.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span id="fig:sound_perception"></span></p>
<p>To formalize this, Thurstone noted that the difference between two
Gaussian distributions is itself Gaussian <span class="citation"
data-cites="weisstein_normal_diff"><a href="#ref-weisstein_normal_diff"
role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span>. Therefore, the percentage of times
that the individual perceives stimulus A as different from stimulus B is
related to the distance between the two stimuli. The percentage of times
an individual chooses <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> directly maps to the distance between
their means in terms of standard deviations. By applying the Inverse
Cumulative Distribution Function (Z-score) to these probabilities to
obtain a distance <span class="math inline">\(D_{AB} = Z\left( P(A &gt;
B) \right)\)</span>,Thurstone leveraged natural human error to create a
quantitative scale.</p>
<p>But wait, we just have a collection of pairwise distances? How do you
build a scale? Today, we might use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), but
that wasn’t developed until the 1950s. If you don’t know what MDS is,
we’ll cover it in a future episode. And also, this is only a One
Dimensional Scale so MDS is overkill when something far simpler would
suffice. Thurstone’s approach was much simpler.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create a pairwise distance matrix <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(D_{ij}\)</span> is the distance (Z-score) between
stimulus <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and stimulus <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> after aggregating over all of the
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Average over the columns of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{D}\)</span> to get a single value for each
stimulus. This is akin to taking a “centroid” of the stimulus by
comparing its relative score and distance to all other stimuli. By
averaging how much ‘better” or ‘worse” a crime is compared to every
other crime in the set, we find its unique coordinate on the moral
map.</p></li>
<li><p>Sort the stimuli based on this centroid to get the
scale.</p></li>
</ol>

probabilities and then averaging over the columns to get the scale for

<h2>Using the 1D scale to evaluate morality</h2>
<p>With this theoretical framework, Thurstone famously applied this for
evaluating the crowdsourced seriousness of crimes <span class="citation"
data-cites="thurstone1927method"><a href="#ref-thurstone1927method"
role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>. He asked 266 participants to make
171 pairwise comparisons across 19 different offenses.</p>
<p>The resulting scale showed that the 1920s American public viewed
Vagrancy and Bootlegging as the least serious crimes while Rape and
Homicide were viewed as the most serious crimes. Given the time, it is
not surprising to see that Abortion and Seduction were viewed as more
serious crimes than Assault and Battery. One could imagine that if today
the same experiment was conducted, the scale would look very
different.</p>

<p>This method was revolutionary for its time as it enabled the
quantitative measurement of abstract psychological percept without
making any assumptions about the underlying percept or asking for
numerical ratings. Later the same method was used to build psychological
scales for a whole other set of phenomena like handwriting and
personality traits <span class="citation"
data-cites="thurstone1931measurement"><a
href="#ref-thurstone1931measurement"
role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span>.</p>
<h2>Limitations of the 1D scale</h2>
<p>As revolutionary as Thurstone’s 1D scale was, it had three major
flaws:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The scale is unidimensional</strong>: Take the following
example: how would you compare the chocolate cake to chocolate croissant
or the pound cake in terms of taste? Do you compare on the texture
(cakeness) or to the mouthfeel (chocolatiness)? Thurstone’s 1D method
assumes that if people are confused between two items it is because they
are identical on the single dimension being measured. Clearly this is
not the case for taste. A 1D scale forces these nuances onto a single
line, losing the complexity of the object.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intransitivity</strong>: Thurstone’s method also assumes
that if <span class="math inline">\(A &gt; B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B &gt; C\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> <em>must</em> be greater than <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. For example, if one were to rank the
three desserts Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Croissant and Pound Cake on
chocolatiness, then the order would likely be Chocolate Cake &gt;
Chocolate Croissant &gt; Pound Cake. However, if one ranked on the
cakeness axis then the order would be Pound Cake &gt; Chocolate Cake
&gt; Chocolate Croissant. A participant may invariably choose to
evaluate on one axis for one query (Chocolate cake vs Chocolate
croissant on chocolatiness) but not for another (Pound cake vs Chocolate
cake on cakeness). Human preference is rarely simple and we often change
our criteria depending on what we are comparing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Scalability</strong>: Collecting every possible
pair for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> stimuli requires <span
class="math inline">\(O\left( N^{2} \right)\)</span> comparisons. This
scales quite poorly with the number of stimuli and quickly becomes
infeasible in human data collection. Thurstone managed to get 266
participants to do 171 comparisons each. That in itself is a feat
especially for 1927! For 25 stimuli this would 625 comparisons and for
50 one would need to collect 2500 comparisons! Good luck with
that.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Coming Up Next….</h2>
<p>Thurstone gave us the psychological ruler, but he kept us trapped on
a single line. In the next episode, we’ll see how researchers finally
“broke out” of the first dimension and developed methods to build
multidimensional psychological spaces. Episode 2 of From Scales to
Spaces is titled “From Ruler to Map” and will be released next.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
