<p>This is episode 1 in series of blog posts that seek to explain how
the representation became a powerful tool in psychology and cognitive
neuroscience from the early 20th century to the present day. The first
episode focusses on the dire straits the field found itself in in the
early 20th century and novel quantitative paradigm that allowed the
field to objectively quantify psychological phenomena (perhaps for the
first time!).</p>
<h2>The Crisis of Confidence</h2>
<p>In the early 20th century, psychology was facing a crisis of
confidence. As Joel Michell pointed out in his very well written
Measurement in Psychology <span class="citation"
data-cites="michell1999measurement">[1]</span>, psychology faced an
immense pressure to be quantitative like Physics at that time was. Note
that Einstein, Bohr and Planck were all revolutionizing the way we think
about the physical world at that time. The main way they were doing this
by coming with new measurement paradigms to model how people viewed the
world. As Michell points out in his book, psychology as a field was not
viewed with much respect by the scientific community and the community
eminently felt a need to be more quantitative to earn legitimacy. This
is not withstanding the fact that the Ferguson report commissioned by
the British Association for the Advancement of Science that finished in
1940, concluded that there is no real way to perform psychological
measurement thereby eviscerating the very foundation of psychology as a
science - at least at the time.</p>
<h2>Why is similarity needed? And why not absolute values?</h2>
<p>The main reason for this evisceration was largely due to the fact
that psychology did not have a ground truth to measure against. The
canonical example from physics is that of length. There exists an
absolute length of a ruler and of the standard measurement units for
length. However, in psychology, there is no rule or scale to measure the
perception of loudness to a sound perceived by an individual.</p>
<p>This becomes even harder when you consider concepts that do not have
a physical correlate like sound does. For example, the beauty of a
painting? How do measure the beauty of a painting with an absolute
scale? You cannot - at least not in a way that is objective and can be
agreed upon by everyone.</p>
<p>[TODO: Have a figure on ruler and the absolute scale but no absolute
scale for a psychological concept]</p>
<p>In the midst of this crisis of the field, L.L. Thurstone in his 1927
paper, A Law of Comparative Judgement <span class="citation"
data-cites="thurstone2017law">[2]</span> proposed a new way to perform
psychological measurement [ignore the year on the citation as I am not
able to find the original 1927 bib entry] argued that while we as humans
may not have an absolute scale, we possess a high sensitive comparison
mechanism to compare any two stimuli via a relative scale.</p>
<p>That is, we are not very good at saying “This light is at 400 lumens”
but we are very good at saying “Light A is brighter than Light B”. The
idea that humans are more consistent in their relative judgements than
absolute judgements has been replicated repeatedly since then <span
class="citation" data-cites="stewart2005absolute">[3]</span>.</p>
<h2>Scales: The 1D Era</h2>
<p>While relative judgements allow one to get around the fact that there
exists no absolute scale to measure against, it still doesn’t allow one
to account for the fact that humans are highly inconsistent in comparing
stimuli due to factors like attention, fatigue etc.</p>
<p>The way that Thurstone was able to explain this is via assuming that
this internal noise could be modelled as a Gaussian Process. More
formally, if two light stimuli <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{A}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{B}\)</span> are presented to an individual
where the perceived brightness is sampled from <span
class="math inline">\(N\left( \mu_{A},\sigma^{2} \right)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(N\left( \mu_{B},\sigma^{2}
\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This way, each time the individual is presented with the same two
stimuli, that individual is essentially using one draw from each of the
two Gaussian distributions to compare them.</p>
<p>Now, to model if the individual perceives stimulus <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as brighter than stimulus <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we can compute the difference between
the two draws, <span class="math inline">\(\delta = x_{A} -
x_{B}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\delta &gt; 0\)</span>, the
individual perceives stimulus <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as
brighter than stimulus <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\delta &lt; 0\)</span>, the
individual perceives stimulus <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as
brighter than stimulus <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider two sets of stimuli. The first is between the sun and a
lightbulb where the human assesses on all trials that the sun is
brighter than the lightbulb. The second is between a lightbulb and a
candle where the human assesses that the lightbulb is brighter than the
candle only about 75% of the time. What this essentially tells you is
that the brightness of the sun is very far from the brightness of the
lightbulb, while the brightness of the lightbulb is closer to the
brightness of the candle.</p>
<p>[Have a figure here showing the relative distances between the sun,
lightbulb and candle]</p>
<p>To formalize this, note that the difference between gaussian
distributions is also gaussian. Therefore, the percentage of times that
the individual perceives stimulus A as different from stimulus B is
related to the distance between the two stimuli.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math inline">\(P(A &gt; B) =
0.5\)</span>, then the distance between the means <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{A}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_{B}\)</span> is 0. If <span
class="math inline">\(P(A &gt; B) = 0.84\)</span>, then the distance
between the means is 1 standard deviation. If <span
class="math inline">\(P(A &gt; B) = 0.977\)</span>, then the distance
between the means is 2 standard deviations.</p>
<p>If these numbers seem familiar, it is because they are essentially
the same numbers that you would see in a standard normal distribution
table. Basically, the Inverse Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) or
the Z-score function evaluated on the probability of A being greater
than B gives you the distance between the means in terms of standard
deviations.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d(A,B) = Z\left( P(A &gt; B)
\right)\]</span></p>
<p>With this technique, Thurstone essentially was able to derive a
quantitative scale for measuring the difference between two stimuli
based on the relative judgements. He turned the natural human error in
judgement into a feature of the measurement scale. (He also described
similar methods for cases where the standard deviation of the internal
noise was not constant across stimuli but the same idea holds)</p>
<p>But wait, we just have a collection of pairwise distances? How do we
go from that to a scale? I know that all of you folks are thinking about
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) here. But that was created only in late
1950s and early 1960s so Thurstone couldn’t have used it. And also, this
is only a One Dimensional Scale so MDS is overkill.</p>
<p>The algorithm is actually pretty simple. They created a pairwise
distance matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(D_{ij}\)</span> is the distance (Z-score) between
stimulus <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and stimulus <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> after aggregating over all of the data.
Then, to find the scale they just averaged over the columns of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to get a single value for each
stimulus. This is akin to taking a “centroid” of the stimulus by
comparing its relative score and distance to all other stimuli. Then, if
you sort the stimuli based on this centroid, you get the scale.</p>
<p>[TODO: Add a figure here showing the pairwise distance matrix and the
centroid]</p>
<h2>Using the 1D scale to evaluate morality</h2>
<p>With this theoretical framework, Thurstone operationalized it to
learn scales for a variety of psychological phenomena but most famously
known for evaluating morality of various crimes <span class="citation"
data-cites="thurstone1927method">[4]</span>.</p>
<p>In that study, Thurstone used the scale to evaluate the morality of
19 crimes to see if there was a scale that could capture the moral
judgments of individuals. He asked a total of 266 participants to
compare every pair of crimes (171 in total) and used the entire
aggregated data to learn the scale.</p>
<p>The resulting scale clearly had semantic sense must be viewed from
the late 1920s moral perspective.</p>
<p>[the thurstone scale figure] Serious crimes like Rape and Homicide
are viewed as most immoral while minor crimes like Bootlegging (selling
alcohol - this was prohibition mind you) and Vagrancy are viewed as
least immoral. One could imagine that today, this scale could look very
different.</p>
<p>This method was revolutionary for its time and was used for a whole
other set of scales to evaluate other psychological phenomena like
handwriting and personality traits <span class="citation"
data-cites="thurstone1931measurement">[5]</span>.</p>
<h2>Limitations of the 1D scale</h2>
<p>However, there were definitely a few issues with this method.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The scale is unidimensional. For example, in the followin
example, it is not clear how one would compare the chocolate cake to
chocolate croissant or the pound cake in terms of taste? Do you compare
on the texture (cakeness) or to the taste (chocalatiness)? Thurstone’s
1D method assumes that if people are confused between two items it is
because they are identical on the single dimension being measured.
Clearly this is not the case for this example. You lose out on this
nuance in the 1D scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Intransitivity: Thurstone’s method also assumes that if <span
class="math inline">\(A &gt; B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B &gt; C\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> must be greater than <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. For example, if one were to evaluate
on the chocalatiness axis then the order would likely be Chocolate Cake
&gt; Chocolate Croissant &gt; Pound Cake. However, if one were to
evaluate on the cakeness axis then the order would be Pound Cake &gt;
Chocolate Cake &gt; Chocolate Croissant. A participant may invariably
choose to evaluate on one axis for one query (Chocolate cake vs
Chocolate croissant on chocolatiness) but not for another (Pound cake vs
Chocolate cake on cakeness). This subtlety is lost in the 1D
scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Needing to collect all the pairwise judgements is very time
consuming and not scalable: In terms of sample complexity, this is <span
class="math inline">\(O\left( N^{2} \right)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of stimuli. This scales
quite poorly with the number of stimuli and quickly becomes infeasible
in human data collection. For 25 stimuli this is 625 comparisons, but
for 50 one would need to collect 2500 comparisons! Good luck with
that.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Next time, we will introduce a method that adds dimensions to
Thurstone’s scale and addresses some of these issues (while amplifying
some of the others!).</p>
